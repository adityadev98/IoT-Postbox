# IoT-Postbox
In an age of Twitter, Facebook, and text messaging, a physical mailbox may seem like a
relic of the dead (letter) past, but postal theft is still a big problem and people still get
annoyed at fruitless journeys to the curb. The smart Internet of Things postbox is a 21st
century variation on the old switch-and-doorbell mailbox alert setup that not only lets you
know when the post arrives along with a nice picture, but is also intended to combat theft.
The IoT-postbox is used to detect new letter in postbox. When a new letter in the postbox
is detected the device sends an e-mail to the user with its picture as an attachment. It uses
rechargeable, solar powered power-bank as the power source. Raspberry Pi, a low power,
small, ARM powered computer is used and its power consumption is optimized.
